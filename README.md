This will be a good year for Horses to expand their horizons, so they should consider attending seminars or furthering their education.

Their lucky stars will help them overcome obstacles, but there are also cursed stars that will lead to accidents, so stay away from high-risk water sports such as scuba diving and jet skiing this year.

Other cursed stars will affect the home and interpersonal relationships. A good way to balance that bad luck would be to follow the Buddhist tradition and be vegetarian on the first and fifteenth days of each lunar calendar month.
